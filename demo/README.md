# `elixir-auth-microsoft` _demo_

A basic demo/example of how to use
Microsoft Auth in a `Phoenix` aplication.

</div>

# _Why_? ü§∑

We love full working examples
with step-by-step instructions.
This demo shows you 
how to get up-and-running as fast as possible.

# _What_? üí≠

A *barebones* demo/exampe `Phoenix` app using 
[`elixir-auth-microsoft`](https://github.com/dwyl/elixir-auth-microsoft)
to add "***Sign-in with Microsoft***".

# _Who_? üë•

This demos is intended for people of all `Elixir`/`Phoenix` skill levels.
Anyone who wants the "***Sign-in with Microsoft***"
without the extra steps to configure a whole auth _framework_.

Following all the steps in this example 
should take around **10 minutes**.
However if you get stuck, please don't suffer in silence!

# _How?_ üíª

## 0. Create a New Phoenix App

Create a new `Phoenix` project if you don't already have one.


```sh
mix phx.new app --no-ecto 
```

> We don't need a database for this demo.

When prompted to install dependencies 
`Fetch and install dependencies? [Yn]`
Type `y` and hit the `[Enter]` key to install.


Make sure that everything works before proceeding:

```sh
mix test
```

You should see:

```sh
Generated app app
...

Finished in 0.02 seconds
3 tests, 0 failures
```

The default tests pass 
and you know the `Phoenix` app is compiling.

Run the app:

```sh
mix phx.server
```

and visit the endpoint in your web browser: 
http://localhost:4000/

## 1. Add the `elixir_auth_microsoft` package to `mix.exs` üì¶

Open your `mix.exs` file 
and add the following line 
to your `deps` list:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:elixir_auth_microsoft, "~> 1.0.0"}
  ]
end
```

Run **`mix deps.get`** to download.

## 2. Create an App Registration in Azure Active Directory ‚ú®

If you're not sure how to proceed with Azure Portal and
setup your Active Directory application, 
please follow the 
[`azure_app_registration_guide.md`](https://github.com/dwyl/elixir-auth-microsoft/blob/main/azure_app_registration_guide.md)
to get your `client_id`
and `secret`.

By the end of this step
you should have these two environment variables defined:

```yml
export MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET=rDq8Q~.uc-237FryAt-lGu7G1sQkKR
export MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID=a3d22eeb-85aa-4650-8ee8-3383931
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Don't worry, these keys aren't valid. 
They are just here for illustration purposes.

## 3. Create 2 New Files  ‚ûï

We need to create two files in order to handle the requests
to the Microsoft Azure APIs and display data to people using our app.

### 3.1 Create a `MicrosoftAuthController` in your Project

So as to display the data returned by the Microsoft Graph API, 
we need to create a new `controller`.

Create a new file called
`lib/app_web/controllers/microsoft_auth_controller.ex`

and add the following code:

```elixir
defmodule AppWeb.MicrosoftAuthController do
  use AppWeb, :controller

  @doc """
  `index/2` handles the callback from Google Auth API redirect.
  """
  def index(conn, %{"code" => code, "state" => state}) do

    # Perform state change here (to prevent CSRF)
    if state !== "random_state_uid" do
      # error handling
    end

    {:ok, token} = ElixirAuthMicrosoft.get_token(code, conn)
    {:ok, profile} = ElixirAuthMicrosoft.get_user_profile(token.access_token)

    conn
    |> put_view(AppWeb.PageView)
    |> render(:welcome, profile: profile)
  end
end
```

Let's review this code:

- Creates a one-time authentication token based on the `code` and, 
optionally `state` sent by Microsoft after the person authenticates.

- Request the account profie data from Microsoft based on
the received `access_token`.

- Render a `:welcome` view displaying some profile data
to confirm that login with Azure was successful.

### 3.2 Create `welcome` template üìù

Create a new file with the following path:
`lib/app_web/templates/page/welcome.html.eex`

And type (_or paste_) the following code in it:
```html
<section class="phx-hero">
  <h1> Welcome <%= @profile.displayName %>!</h1>
  <p> You are <strong>signed in</strong>
    with your <strong>Microsoft Account</strong> <br />
    <strong style="color:teal;"><%= @profile.userPrincipalName %></strong>
  </p>
</section>
```

> **Note**: we are placing the
>  `welcome.html.eex` template
> in the `template/page` directory to save having to create
> any more directories and view files.
> You are free to organise your code however you prefer.


The Microsoft Graph API 
[`get_profile`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/profile-get?view=graph-rest-beta&tabs=http)
request returns profile data in the following format:

```elixir
%{
  businessPhones: [],
  displayName: "Test Name",
  givenName: "Test",
  id: "192jnsd9010apd",
  jobTitle: nil,
  mail: nil,
  mobilePhone: '+351928837834',
  officeLocation: nil,
  preferredLanguage: nil,
  surname: "Name",
  userPrincipalName: "testemail@hotmail.com"
}
```

## 4. Add the `/auth/microsoft/callback` to `router.ex`

Open your `lib/app_web/router.ex` file
and locate the section that looks like `scope "/", AppWeb do`

Add the following line:

```elixir
get "/auth/microsoft/callback", MicrosoftAuthController, :index
```

That will direct the API request response
to the `MicrosoftAuthController` `:index` function we defined above.


## 5. Update `PageController.index`

In order to display the "Sign-in with Microsoft" button in the UI,
we need to _generate_ the URL for the button in the relevant controller,
and pass it to the template.

Open the `lib/app_web/controllers/page_controller.ex` file
and update the `index` function:

From:
```elixir
def index(conn, _params) do
  render(conn, "index.html")
end
```

To:
```elixir
def index(conn, _params) do
  state = "random_state_uid"

  oauth_microsoft_url = ElixirAuthMicrosoft.generate_oauth_url_authorize(conn, state)
  render(conn, "index.html",[oauth_microsoft_url: oauth_microsoft_url])
end
```

### 5.1 Update the `page/index.html.eex` Template

Open the `/lib/app_web/templates/page/index.html.eex` file
and type the following code:

```html
<section class="phx-hero">
  <h1>Welcome to Awesome App!</h1>
  <p>To get started, login to your Microsoft Account: </p>
  <a href={@oauth_microsoft_url}>
    <img src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/media/howto-add-branding-in-azure-ad-apps/ms-symbollockup_signin_light.png" alt="Sign in with Microsoft" />
  </a>
</section>
```

The home page of the app now has a big "Sign in with Microsoft" button:

![sign-in-button](https://20o8nn37v3mzb7unq3fsj61e-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Sign-in-with-Microsoft-Button.png)

e.g:

Once the person completes their authentication with Microsoft,
they should see the following welcome message, 
with your account name and display name:

![auth-success-welcome](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/196753288-31b1ddd3-8e4e-40e6-bf7d-35214a05c546.png)
