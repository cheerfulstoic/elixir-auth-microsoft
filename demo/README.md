# `elixir-auth-microsoft` _demo_

A basic demo/example of how to use
Microsoft Auth in a `Phoenix` aplication.

</div>

# _Why_? ü§∑

We love full working examples
with step-by-step instructions.
This demo shows you 
how to get up-and-running as fast as possible.

# _What_? üí≠

A *barebones* demo/exampe `Phoenix` app using 
[`elixir-auth-microsoft`](https://github.com/dwyl/elixir-auth-microsoft)
to add "***Sign-in with Microsoft***".

# _Who_? üë•

This demos is intended for people of all `Elixir`/`Phoenix` skill levels.
Anyone who wants the "***Sign-in with Microsoft***"
without the extra steps to configure a whole auth _framework_.

Following all the steps in this example 
should take around **10 minutes**.
However if you get stuck, please don't suffer in silence!

# _How?_ üíª

## 0. Create a New Phoenix App

Create a new `Phoenix` project if you don't already have one.


```sh
mix phx.new app --no-ecto 
```

> We don't need a database for this demo.

When prompted to install dependencies 
`Fetch and install dependencies? [Yn]`
Type `y` and hit the `[Enter]` key to install.


Make sure that everything works before proceeding:

```sh
mix test
```

You should see:

```sh
Generated app app
...

Finished in 0.02 seconds
3 tests, 0 failures
```

The default tests pass 
and you know the `Phoenix` app is compiling.

Run the app:

```sh
mix phx.server
```

and visit the endpoint in your web browser: 
http://localhost:4000/

## 1. Add the `elixir_auth_microsoft` package to `mix.exs` üì¶

Open your `mix.exs` file 
and add the following line 
to your `deps` list:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:elixir_auth_microsoft, "~> 1.0.0"}
  ]
end
```

Run **`mix deps.get`** to download.

## 2. Create an App Registration in Azure Active Directory ‚ú®

If you're not sure how to proceed with Azure Portal and
setup your Active Directory application, 
please follow the 
[`azure_app_registration_guide.md`](https://github.com/dwyl/elixir-auth-microsoft/blob/main/azure_app_registration_guide.md)
to get your `client_id`
and `secret`.

By the end of this step
you should have these two environment variables defined:

```yml
export MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET=rDq8Q~.uc-237FryAt-lGu7G1sQkKR
export MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID=a3d22eeb-85aa-4650-8ee8-3383931
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Don't worry, these keys aren't valid. 
They are just here for illustration purposes.

## 3. Create 2 New Files  ‚ûï

We need to create two files in order to handle the requests
to the Microsoft Azure APIs and display data to people using our app.

### 3.1 Create a `MicrosoftAuthController` in your Project

So as to display the data returned by the Microsoft Graph API, 
we need to create a new `controller`.

Create a new file called
`lib/app_web/controllers/microsoft_auth_controller.ex`

and add the following code:

```elixir
defmodule AppWeb.MicrosoftAuthController do
  use AppWeb, :controller

  @doc """
  `index/2` handles the callback from Google Auth API redirect.
  """
  def index(conn, %{"code" => code, "state" => state}) do

    # Perform state change here (to prevent CSRF)
    if state !== "random_state_uid" do
      # error handling
    end

    {:ok, token} = ElixirAuthMicrosoft.get_token(code, conn)
    {:ok, profile} = ElixirAuthMicrosoft.get_user_profile(token.access_token)

    conn
    |> put_view(AppWeb.PageView)
    |> render(:welcome, profile: profile)
  end
end
```

Let's review this code:

- Creates a one-time authentication token based on the `code` and, 
optionally `state` sent by Microsoft after the person authenticates.

- Request the account profie data from Microsoft based on
the received `access_token`.

- Render a `:welcome` view displaying some profile data
to confirm that login with Azure was successful.

### 3.2 Create `welcome` template üìù

Create a new file with the following path:
`lib/app_web/templates/page/welcome.html.eex`

And type (_or paste_) the following code in it:
```html
<section class="phx-hero">
  <h1> Welcome <%= @profile.displayName %>!</h1>
  <p> You are <strong>signed in</strong>
    with your <strong>Microsoft Account</strong> <br />
    <strong style="color:teal;"><%= @profile.userPrincipalName %></strong>
  </p>
</section>
```

> **Note**: we are placing the
>  `welcome.html.eex` template
> in the `template/page` directory to save having to create
> any more directories and view files.
> You are free to organise your code however you prefer.


The Microsoft Graph API 
[`get_profile`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/profile-get?view=graph-rest-beta&tabs=http)
request returns profile data in the following format:

```elixir
%{
  businessPhones: [],
  displayName: "Test Name",
  givenName: "Test",
  id: "192jnsd9010apd",
  jobTitle: nil,
  mail: nil,
  mobilePhone: '+351928837834',
  officeLocation: nil,
  preferredLanguage: nil,
  surname: "Name",
  userPrincipalName: "testemail@hotmail.com"
}
```

## 4. Add the `/auth/microsoft/callback` to `router.ex`

Open your `lib/app_web/router.ex` file
and locate the section that looks like `scope "/", AppWeb do`

Add the following line:

```elixir
get "/auth/microsoft/callback", MicrosoftAuthController, :index
```

That will direct the API request response
to the `MicrosoftAuthController` `:index` function we defined above.


## 5. Update `PageController.index`

In order to display the "Sign-in with Microsoft" button in the UI,
we need to _generate_ the URL for the button in the relevant controller,
and pass it to the template.

Open the `lib/app_web/controllers/page_controller.ex` file
and update the `index` function:

From:
```elixir
def index(conn, _params) do
  render(conn, "index.html")
end
```

To:
```elixir
def index(conn, _params) do
  state = "random_state_uid"

  oauth_microsoft_url = ElixirAuthMicrosoft.generate_oauth_url_authorize(conn, state)
  render(conn, "index.html",[oauth_microsoft_url: oauth_microsoft_url])
end
```

### 5.1 Update the `page/index.html.eex` Template

Open the `/lib/app_web/templates/page/index.html.eex` file
and type the following code:

```html
<section class="phx-hero">
  <h1>Welcome to Awesome App!</h1>
  <p>To get started, login to your Microsoft Account: </p>
  <a href={@oauth_microsoft_url}>
    <img src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/media/howto-add-branding-in-azure-ad-apps/ms-symbollockup_signin_light.png" alt="Sign in with Microsoft" />
  </a>
</section>
```

The home page of the app now has a big "Sign in with Microsoft" button:

![sign-in-button](https://20o8nn37v3mzb7unq3fsj61e-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Sign-in-with-Microsoft-Button.png)

e.g:

![elixir-auth-microsoft-demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/196782404-0918edf9-65e1-4a4d-b676-31bd10b8cd42.png)

Once the person completes their authentication with Microsoft,
they should see the following welcome message, 
with your account name and display name:

![auth-success-welcome](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/196753288-31b1ddd3-8e4e-40e6-bf7d-35214a05c546.png)


## 6 Maintaining the token in session

Currently, if you refresh the page,
the token is not persisted 
and you lose your "logged in" status.

To fix this,
we are going to put the retrieved token
in the `conn` session.

Firstly, let's change the 
"app" page to its own.
Go to `lib/app_web/router.ex`
and add the following route
in the `scope "/"`.

```elixir
scope "/", AppWeb do
  pipe_through :browser

  get "/", PageController, :index
  get "/welcome", PageController, :welcome   # add this one
  get "/auth/microsoft/callback", MicrosoftAuthController, :index
end
```

We're going to make the person 
redirect to `/welcome` after successful login.
Go to `lib/app_web/controllers/page_controller.ex`
and add the following function.

```elixir
  def welcome(conn, _params) do

    # Check if there's a session token
    case conn |> get_session(:token) do

      # If not, we redirect the person to the login page
      nil ->
        conn |> redirect(to: "/")

      # If there's a token, we render the welcome page
      token ->
        {:ok, profile} = ElixirAuthMicrosoft.get_user_profile(token.access_token)

        conn
        |> put_view(AppWeb.PageView)
        |> render(:welcome, profile: profile)
    end
  end
```

We are using the 
[`get_session`](https://hexdocs.pm/plug/Plug.Conn.html#get_session/2)
to retrieve the `token` from the session.
We've *yet* to place it there in the first place,
but don't worry, we'll do it next!
If no `token` is found,
we redirect the person to the homepage to login.
If it is, we render the page normally!

Now let's put the `token` in the session
after the person logs in successfully.

In `lib/app_web/controllers/microsoft_auth_controller.ex`,
change the `index` function to the following:

```elixir
  def index(conn, %{"code" => code, "state" => state}) do

    # Perform state change here (to prevent CSRF)
    if state !== "random_state_uid" do
      # error handling
    end

    {:ok, token} = ElixirAuthMicrosoft.get_token(code, conn)


    conn
    |> put_session(:token, token)
    |> redirect(to: "/welcome")
  end
```

We are simply using the
[`put_session`](https://hexdocs.pm/plug/Plug.Conn.html#put_session/3)
function to persist the token within the connection session
to later be retrieved by the page
after successful login.
The person is redirected to the `/welcome` page
we've defined earlier if they manage to login.

And that's it!
If you refresh the `/welcome` page,
the token won't be lost! üéâ
